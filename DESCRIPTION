Title: Patel 2014 Human Glioblastoma Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Will Townes and Stephanie Hicks
Maintainer: Will Townes <will.townes@gmail.com>
Description: This package contains a Bioconductor "Summarized Experiment"
    from the Patel et al. (2014) paper that performed single cell RNA-Seq
    analysis on human glioblastoma tissue. There are also some cell line
    and bulk RNA-Seq samples included. Metadata was obtained from Gene
    Expression Omnibus and raw FASTQ files were downloaded from Sequence
    Read Archive. All samples were quantified using Kallisto. The data
    provided are the estimated counts for ENSEMBL genes for all samples,
    not just the ones that were included in the authors' analysis.
